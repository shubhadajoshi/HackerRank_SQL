QUE : You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.
COLUMN  TYPE
X       integer
y       integer
Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.
Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.
Sample Input
x y
2 24
4 22
24 2
22 4
2 2
2 2
Sample Output
2 2
2 24
4 22

QUE: Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's  key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.
Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.acual - miscalculated average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.
Input Format
The EMPLOYEES table is described as follows:
col type
id int
name string
salary int

Sample Output
2061
--------------------------------------
ans : with cte_1 as
(select id , name ,salary, REPLACE(salary, '0', '') as mis_cal_sal 
 from employees)
 select CEILING(avg(salary) - avg(mis_cal_sal)) from cte_1
 ;
